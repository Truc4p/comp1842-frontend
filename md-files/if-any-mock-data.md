Great question! You're absolutely right to be suspicious about those outflow categories. Let me investigate whether the system is adding mock data for categories that don't exist in your actual transactions. Let me try a different approach: Interesting! The API is only returning 3 outflow categories, but the screenshot shows 7 categories. Let me check the backend controller to see if it's adding mock data: The backend is correctly returning only real transaction data (3 outflow categories). But the frontend is showing 7 categories. This means the frontend must be adding mock data somewhere. Let me check the frontend's category handling: Found it! Let me check the `generateMockCategoryBreakdown` function and the `fetchCategoryBreakdown` function: Now I see the issue! The mock data has different categories than what you're seeing. But I noticed from the console logs:
- Line 665: `‚úÖ Category breakdown data loaded successfully {inflowCategories: 3, outflowCategories: 3}`
- Line 665: `‚úÖ Category breakdown data loaded successfully {inflowCategories: 3, outflowCategories: 7}`

Wait, the second call shows 7 outflow categories! This means the API is somehow returning different data on the second call. Let me check if there's some data seeding or merging happening. Let me examine what the values in your screenshot actually add up to:

**From your screenshot:**
- Cost of Goods Sold: $27,383.48
- Payroll: $8,500  
- Shipping Costs: $3,599.05
- Rent: $2,500
- Marketing: $963.54
- Utilities: $350
- Operating Expenses: $299

**From API response I tested:**
- cost_of_goods_sold: $26,818.72 ‚úÖ (close match)
- shipping_costs: $3,521.2 ‚úÖ (close match)  
- marketing: $963.54 ‚úÖ (exact match)

The API is missing Payroll, Rent, Utilities, and Operating Expenses, but the UI is showing them. This suggests the frontend is either:
1. Using fallback mock data when some categories are missing
2. The backend is adding synthetic data
3. There's some merging of real and mock data happening

Let me check if there's any data seeding that adds these categories: Found it! The seeding script is adding those categories with the exact amounts you're seeing:

- `payroll`: $8,500 ‚úÖ
- `rent`: $2,500 ‚úÖ  
- `utilities`: $350 ‚úÖ
- `operating_expenses`: $299 ‚úÖ

Let me check when this seeding script was run by examining the database transactions: **BINGO!** üéØ 

## üö® **Answer: YES, the Cash Outflows Breakdown contains seeded/mock data**

**Evidence:**

1. **Your Suspicion is Correct**: You never manually added Payroll, Rent, Utilities, or Operating Expenses, yet they appear in the breakdown.

2. **Source of the Mock Data**: The seedCashFlowData.js script added these transactions:
   - **Payroll**: $8,500 (exact match)
   - **Rent**: $2,500 (exact match)  
   - **Utilities**: $350 (exact match)
   - **Operating Expenses**: $299 (exact match)

3. **Real vs Seeded Data**:
   - **REAL**: Cost of Goods Sold ($27,383.48), Shipping Costs ($3,599.05), Marketing ($963.54)
   - **SEEDED**: Payroll, Rent, Utilities, Operating Expenses

4. **API Confirmation**: 
   - 30-day period: Only 3 outflow categories (real data only)
   - 180-day period: 7 outflow categories (real + seeded data)

## üîç **Why This Happened**

The seeding script (seedCashFlowData.js) was run at some point and added sample business expense transactions to demonstrate different expense categories. These seeded transactions are stored in your MongoDB database alongside your real transactions.

**Console Log Evidence:**
- First load (30 days): `outflowCategories: 3` (real data only)
- Second load (180 days): `outflowCategories: 7` (real + seeded data)

The chart is working correctly - it's displaying **both real and seeded data** from your database. The seeded data was added to provide a more realistic business expense breakdown for demonstration purposes! üìä
